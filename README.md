## Purpose and history
Originally created for a customer who required a weekly time sheet in html format via email in a very specific format, for approval puposes. This one single html-css-js page allows to fill the form in a few click, none on a typical week, rather than waste time editing a complicated template.

## Usage
Either:
- Load [the html file on htmlpreview.github.io](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dorfsmay/timesheetu1/blob/main/timesheetu1.html) in your browser

Or:
- download [timesheetu1.html](timesheetu1.html)
- modify the html and javascript if needed
- point your browser to file:///path/to/your/file

Then:
- adjust date and hours if needed
- select the table and copy
- paste in an html email

_note_: There is a bug in Firefox, copy/paste of rich text does not copy the styling. Use Chromium for now.
